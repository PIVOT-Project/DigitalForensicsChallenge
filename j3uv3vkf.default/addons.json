This extension even allows you to control selectively for which webpages form history data is stored (either blacklist or whitelist). Also stores text from editor fields as you type for easy recovery in case of disaster.\n\nThis extension enables you to selectively delete privacy sensitive information without having to delete the entire history. With the help of powerful regular expressions, information can simply and effectively be retrieved, edited or deleted. Use it to correct misspelled entries, get rid of sensitive data like private banking info or delete passwords that were entered into the wrong formfield.\n\nThis plugin also stores text from editor fields as you type, so you never have to loose your work when disaster strikes. Recover your lost work after session timeouts, network failures, browser crashes, power failures and all other things that will destroy the hard work you just put into writing that important email, essay or blog post.\n\nForm History Control can filter data either by keyword, active page, active field or cleanup criteria. Powerful advanced search options allows you to find information by name, value, timeframe, usage or host. Optional regular expressions provide a very effective way to retrieve any information you might look for. The advanced search option comes with a list of predefined regular expressions which can be altered or extended to fit any need.\n\nThe extension also offers the possibility to export/import form history data and configuration settings, allowing you to exchange data between multiple browser configurations or import history data into your own application of choice.\n\nForm History Control can also be used to easily autofill textfields in a web form using either the most used or the last used formhistory data.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/82/82668.png?src=api&modified=1353289282","width":"700","height":"402","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/82/82668.png?src=api&modified=1353289282","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"115","caption":"The
